Projects Where I'm Practicing! :D

I wanted to share a project with friends and decided this would be the best way! :)

I am currently going through Al Sweigart's Automate the Boring Stuff (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and got to chapter 3's practice project and was very happy with my result!

Currently, everything is written in the latest version of python.

List of programs:
 - collatz - First practice program that I was excited about completing, from Automate the Boring Stuff.
 - castOnMath - A small personal program I tossed together to help me do math I didn't feel like doing to knit something and figured I'd make convenient to share with others. :)
    - Now in a single EXE file! If you want to use this program and you're on windows (the (currently) only supported OS), I reccomend only downloading it and not also the .py file, otherwise you'll have to fiddle around with running it with python directly :)
