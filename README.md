Projects Where I'm Practicing! :D

I wanted to share a project with friends and decided this would be the best way! :)

I am currently going through Al Sweigart's Automate the Boring Stuff (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and got to chapter 3's practice project and was very happy with my result!
